/**
 * Pure adaptive cadence policy for Iternio Telemetry sends.
 *
 * State precedence: CHARGING > PARKED > DRIVING. Charging always wins when
 * the gun is connected, because losing fast-charge SOC samples is the
 * single most visible degradation on ABRP charts.
 *
 * Intervals are tuned to:
 *  - DRIVING — 1 s. Iternio rates sources by samples-per-10s for `power`
 *    and `speed`; 1 Hz is what teslamate-abrp / OVMS use during drives.
 *  - CHARGING — 8 s. Under the 10-s Iternio accuracy window with margin;
 *    matches teslamate-abrp's ~6-10s charging cadence.
 *  - PARKED — 30 s. Keeps the session alive on ABRP without spamming the
 *    radio when nothing is changing.

     * the DiPars reduced-payload case — collapse to PARKED unless we have

     * fallback, not as a primary signal — gear remains authoritative when
